## Thomas Cranny

---


## What?
Visualise the UQ St. Lucia Campus in 3D.


---


## Why?
- Logical extension of previous topic. 
- Display UQ spatially
    - Better comprehension then 2D map provides.
- Interesting and relevant visualisation.

Note: Not a direct continuation of previous topic, just the theme.
